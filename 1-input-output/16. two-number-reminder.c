17. Write a C program to swap two integers.
	Expected Output:
	Input the a and b values: 45  31

	Before Swapping
	value of a is: 45 
	value of b is: 31 

	After Swapping 
	value of a is: 31 
	value of b is: 45

18. Write a C program to swap three integers.
	Expected Output:
	Input the x,y and z values: 28  13  89

	Before Swapping
	value of x is: 28
	value of y is: 13 
	value of z is: 89

	After Swapping 
	value of x is: 13
	value of y is: 89
	value of z is: 28

19. Write a C program to swap two integers without using any extra variables, only use two variables.
	Expected Output:
	Input the m and n value: 76  43
	Before Swapping: m = 76, n = 43 
	After Swapping: n = 76, m = 43

20. Write a C program to find the BMI(Body Mass Index) is a person  weight in kilograms divided by 
    the square of height in meters.

	Expected Output:
	Input the weight in kg: 48
	Input the height in cm: 168.5
	BMI = 48 / (1.685)^2  = 16.9060219
